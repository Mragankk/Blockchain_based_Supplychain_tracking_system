# BLOCKCHAIN BASED SUPPLYCHAIN TRACKING SYSTEM

A blockchain-based supply chain tracking system utilizes blockchain technology to enhance transparency, traceability, and security throughout the supply chain process.

**Decentralized Ledger:**
- All transactions and data exchanges within the supply chain are recorded. Each participant in the supply chain network has a copy of this ledger, ensuring transparency and eliminating the need for a central authority.

**Traceability:**
- Enables complete traceability of products from their origin to their final destination. Each step in the supply chain, from raw material sourcing to manufacturing, packaging, distribution, and retail, is recorded on the blockchain. This transparency helps in identifying inefficiencies, reducing fraud, and ensuring compliance with regulations.

**Immutable Records:**
- Once recorded on the blockchain, data cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the integrity of the supply chain records. This feature prevents tampering and fraud, as any attempt to modify data would require consensus from the majority of participants in the network.

**Enhanced Security:**
- Employs cryptographic techniques to secure data and transactions. Each participant in the network has a unique cryptographic key, and transactions are encrypted, making them highly secure. This reduces the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks.

**Real-time Monitoring:**
- Participants in the supply chain can access real-time updates and insights into the movement of goods, inventory levels, and production status. This real-time visibility helps in making informed decisions and quickly addressing any issues that may arise.

**Compliance and Auditing:**
- Blockchain-based supply chain systems facilitate easier compliance with regulations and standards. Auditors can access the immutable records on the blockchain to verify compliance at each stage of the supply chain.

## PicoSHA2
- We use picoSHA2 library to perform SHA-256 hashing in the project.
- SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-size (256-bit or 32-byte) hash value from input data of arbitrary size.

## Pre-requisites:

```
gcc (mingw-32 for windows)
picosha2

```
